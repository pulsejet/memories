This setup utilizes a separate docker container that contains the hardware drivers and ffmpeg. If you cannot do this, other installation methods are also possible.</p> <p>go-vod, the transcoder of Memories, comes with a pre-built Docker image based on <code>linuxserver/ffmpeg</code>. The docker image connects to your Nextcloud instance and pulls the go-vod binary on startup. To set up an external transcoder, follow these steps.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> that runs the go-vod container and mounts the Nextcloud data directories to it. You must specify <code>NEXTCLOUD_HOST</code> to match the name of your Nextcloud container.</p> <pre><code>services:\n  server:\n    image: nextcloud\n    volumes:\n      - ncdata:/var/www/html\n\n  go-vod:\n    image: radialapps/go-vod\n    restart: always\n    init: true\n    depends_on:\n      - server\n    environment:\n      - NEXTCLOUD_HOST=https://your-nextcloud-url\n      # - NEXTCLOUD_ALLOW_INSECURE=1 # (self-signed certs or no HTTPS)\n      - NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all\n    devices:\n      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri # VA-API (omit for NVENC)\n    volumes:\n      - ncdata:/var/www/html:ro\n    # runtime: nvidia # (NVENC)\n</code></pre> <p>Device and volume bindings</p> <p>In this example, the VA-API devices in <code>/dev/dri</code> are passed to the container, along with the Nextcloud data directory (as readonly). All volumes must be mounted at the same location as the Nextcloud container.</p> <p>What to set in <code>NEXTCLOUD_HOST</code>?</p> <p>The <code>NEXTCLOUD_HOST</code> environment variable must be set to the URL of your Nextcloud instance. If you are using a reverse proxy, you must set this to the URL of the reverse proxy. If you are using a self-signed certificate or http, you must also set <code>NEXTCLOUD_ALLOW_INSECURE=1</code>. This URL is used to download the transcoder binary and to connect to the Nextcloud instance.</p> <p>Setup for NVENC</p> <p>If you want to use NVENC instead of VA-API, uncomment the <code>runtime</code> line and remove the <code>devices</code> section above. You will need to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on your host. You may also need to switch to the CUDA scaler in the Memories admin panel.</p> <p>If you are running on Windows WSL 2, you can choose to use Docker's native support by adding resources to the container using <code>docker run</code> or in <code>docker-compose</code>. Alternatively, you can choose to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit meta-version in WSL, then use <code>runtime: nvidia</code> to enable GPU support inside the container.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can now configure the go-vod connect address in the Memories admin panel to point to the external container. go-vod uses port <code>47788</code> by default, so in our example the connection address would be set to <code>go-vod:47788</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, turn on enable external transcoder in the admin panel. This will initiate a test of the transcoder and show the result.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Your external transcoder should now be functional.
