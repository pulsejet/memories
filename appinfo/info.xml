- **🖼️ Albums**: Create albums to group photos and videos together. Then share these albums with others.
- **🫱🏻‍🫲🏻 External Sharing**: Share photos and videos with people outside of your Nextcloud instance.

- **🗺️ Map**: View your photos on a map, tagged with accurate reverse geocoding.
- **🧳 Trips (Beta)**: Automatically detect trips from your photos and create beautiful highlight videos.
- **📦 Migration**: Migrate easily from Nextcloud Photos and Google Takeout.
- **⚡️ Performance**: Do all this very fast.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Install the app from the Nextcloud app store (try a demo [here](https://demo.memories.gallery/apps/memories/)).
1. Perform the recommended [configuration steps](https://memories.gallery/config/).
1. Run `php occ memories:index` to generate metadata indices for existing photos.
1. Open the 📷 Memories app in Nextcloud and set the directory containing your photos.

## 🧳 Trips Feature (Beta)

Memories automatically detects trips from your photos based on time and location data. To use this feature:

1. Run `php occ memories:trips:direct-detect --user <username>` to detect trips for a specific user.
2. Generate highlight videos with `php occ memories:trips:generate-video <username> --trip-id <id>`.
3. View your trips in the Trips tab and enjoy the automatically generated highlight videos.

**Note**: The trip detection feature is currently in beta. The clustering algorithms (TimeGap and HDBSCAN) are still being refined and may benefit from expert attention to improve accuracy. Results may vary depending on your photo collection's metadata quality and distribution patterns.
